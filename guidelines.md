# The Abstract
The brief description which will appear in the online program and give attendees a basic sense of your talk.

# The Long Description
Your placement in the program will be based on reviews of your detailed description. This should be a roughly 500 word detailed outline of your presentation. This outline should concisely describe software of interest to the SciPy community, tools or techniques for more effective computing, or how scientific Python was applied to solve a research problem. A traditional background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion structure is encouraged but not required. Links to project websites, source code repositories, figures, full papers, and evidence of public speaking ability are encouraged.

# Tips for Submitting a Proposal
The SciPy Conference is in awe of the work that is being done in the community. We receive many interesting and thought-provoking proposals but we have a limited number of spaces. Please take a look at our tips below to improve your chances of having a talk or poster accepted by the conference. In the unfortunate event that your proposal is not accepted, please keep in mind that you are welcome to give a lightning talk, book a room for a Birds of a Feather discussion, or talk to the Program Committee about displaying your work as a poster in lieu of a talk.

* Submit your proposal early.
* In your abstract, be sure to include answers to some basic questions:
  * Who is the intended audience for your talk?
  * What, specifically, will attendees learn from your talk?
* Ensure that your talk will be relevant to a broad range of people. If your talk is on a particular Python package or piece of software, it should useful to more than a niche group.
* Include links to source code, articles, blog posts, or other writing that adds context to the presentation.
* If you've given a talk, tutorial, or other presentation before, include that information as well as a link to slides or a video if they're available.
* SciPy talks are generally 25 minutes with 2-3 minutes for questions. Please keep the length of time in mind as you structure your outline.
* Your talk should not be a commercial for your companyâ€™s product. However, you are welcome to talk about how your company solved a problem, or notable open-source projects that may benefit attendees.
